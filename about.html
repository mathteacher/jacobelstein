title: About
---

I'm currently a stay at home dad in Tacoma, Washington. I taught high school math, physics, and computer science from September 2010 - June 2017, but am now grateful to be able to focus on shepherding my daughter through elementary school. My current passions are web development, hiking, seeing live music, playing the piano, writing, and cooking.
