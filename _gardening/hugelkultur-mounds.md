title:	"Hugelkultur Mounds"
---

Here is the eastern half of my backyard before I began the process of building five hugelkultur mounds. A significant amount of time went into preparing this part of the yard. Two rose bushes and numerous bulbs had to be relocated. The most intense work went into removing the root systems of two previously chopped down huge bushes.

Many people when building hugelkultur mounds will dig up any sod, put it aside, and then put it upside down as one of the top layers. Because the top soil in the North End of Tacoma is contaminated with heavy metals, I decided it was best to just leave the sod in place and build my mounds on top. To kill all the grass I gathered a crazy amount of cardboard (a community effort, thank you everyone who contributed!!!) and blanketed the area.

The first stage of building the mounds was to layout a base of large logs (see the [Backyard Parking Slab page](/gardening/hugelkultur-backyard-parking-slab) for more details about the types and origins of the wood).

The next stage was to add medium sized logs and then all different sized branches.

After recieving a chip drop (see the [Backyard Parking Slab page](/gardening/hugelkultur-backyard-parking-slab) for details), I then spread a really thick layer of arborist wood chips in the pathways between the mounds.

I added the last bit of wood chips on top of the mounds to try and fill in the gaps, and then added the first layer of Tagro Mix (see the [Backyard Parking Slab page](/gardening/hugelkultur-backyard-parking-slab) for details), which is comparable to steer manure.
