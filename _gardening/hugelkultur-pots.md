title:	"Hugelkultur Pots"
---

I wanted some kind of border for my big hugelkultur mound garden on the two sides not adjacent to my fence, and the idea that I settled on was to create a border out of pots. And so of course I decided to make them into hugelkultur pots. I purchased twenty 20 gallon black plastic pots (the most expensive single purchase invovled in setting up the whole garden). At the bottom I placed medium sized logs cut down to fit the pots.

Next I added branches of all sizes.

The spaces were then filled in with arborist wood chips.

I filled the pots nearly the rest of the way with TAGRO Mix.

A layer of mostly finished compost was then added.

Followed by a thin layer of potting soil on the very top.
