title:	"Hugelkultur Raised Bed"
---

This project was actually my first attempt in using the hugelkultur technqiue. After much research, I purchased a [Birdies](https://birdiesgardenproducts.com) metal framed raised bed. I dug down, removing a significant amount of top soil, to allow enough space for logs and other layers of organic matter.

I started with a layer of large logs with the spaces in between them filled with branches.

The spaces were then more fully filled in with arborist wood chips.

Next was a layer of medium sized logs and branches of all sizes.

A thick layer of horse manure (I got it for free through the [Pierce Conservation District Manure Share](https://piercecd.org/415/Manure-Share-Program)) was then added.

Then a layer of arborist wood chips.

Followed by another thick layer of horse manure.

Finally a thin layer of Tagro Potting Soil.

I grew spinach and arugula with moderate success in the bed this past fall/winter/spring (the arugula did pretty well, but the spinach got eaten up by something). Currently there is a cover crop of crimson clover growing, mainly just to try it out since I am very curious about cover crops. But the clover should also give a timely nitrogen boost to the bed before planting it out next spring with asparagus.
