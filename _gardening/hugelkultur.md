title:	"Hugelkultur"

Hugelkultur (Mound Culture) is a horticultural technique in which logs are buried and then covered with other organic layers to slowly decompose over time. Crops grown on top need significantly less watering (or none at all for very large mounds) due to the water absorbed by the logs over winter that is then slowly released to the surrounding soil all summer. The decomposing layers also provide a perfect environment for beneficial microbes and earth worms to flourish, feeding the soil for two to three decades.

Here are descriptions and photos of my attempt in 2020 - 2021 to implement three different forms of hugelkultur. I've also included pictures of the materials that were gathered and then disbursed from my backyard parking slab.
